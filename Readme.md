# Product Image Card built by Ritankar Saha

Welcome to the coding project.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download:**
   - If using Git, clone the repository using the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ritankarsaha/Product-Details-Card.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the code as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**

3. **Explore the Structure:**
Take a moment to review the project structure:

        project-root/
        |-- index.html
        |-- style.css
        |-- script.js
        |-- README.md
        |--/public/cart.jpeg
        |--/public/mainimage.jpeg
        |--/cart/thumbnail.jpeg
- `index.html`: Main HTML file for your project.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for scripting logic.
- `README.md`: Documentation for your project.
  

## Development and Testing

4. **Start Working:**
- Open `index.html` in your browser to view the initial state of the project. For this you will need a Live Server extension on your code editor. I suggest Live Server by Ritwick Dey if you are using VS Code. 
- Modify the `style.css` and `script.js` files to see the styling code and the functionality code respectively.
5. **Testing:**
- Test your code to ensure it produces the expected output.
- Ensure that the console (Developer Tools) does not display any errors and also shows it responsive across all devices.
